# birthday-palindrome
This project takes your birthdate as input and determines whether it is a palindrome or not.  
If the birthdate is not a palindrome, it finds out the nearest palindrome date and informs you the number of days by which you missed the palindrome date.  
  
Given a birthdate, the app checks if its a palindrome atleast in any one of these date formats: ddmmyyyy, mmddyyyy, yyyymmdd, ddmmyy, mmddyy.
